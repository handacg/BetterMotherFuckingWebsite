<H1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</H1>
<p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
<H2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</H2>
<p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong></p>
<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"> grotesque pile of shit </a>into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is just a test</li>
	<li><em>Still</em>fits on all your shitty screens</li>
	<li><em>Still</em>looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
	<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em>legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
</ul>

<H3>And guess what, motherfucker:</H3>
<P>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</P>
<H2>Let it breathe</H2>
<P>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</P>

<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
<H2>A little less contrast</H2>
<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.

</p>
<H2>Size Matters</H2>
<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
<H2>Line-width, motherfucker</H2>
<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
<H3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</H3>
<p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration did.</a> What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
